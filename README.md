# Project Euler Solutions

My attempts at solving Project Euler's problems.

As you might expect, these solutions are not meant to be _optimal_ or even _good_, I just need them to work fine. I will try to respect the "1 minute rule": basically, all the solutions should take _a lot_ less than one minute to be calculated.
